%   Checks if the line joining two points is intersected by 
% ï¿½ any of the buildings.

%   testpoints is (2 x 2) matrix where
%   testpoints(:,1) is the first endpoint and
%   testpoints(:,2) is the the second endpoint of the line segment.

% XYCoordinates: Has coordinates of all buildings. It is a 3D array.
%    The indices are as follows BuildingXYCoord[building number][vertex
%    number][X or Y coordinate]
% klast: This array stores the number of vertices of the building+1 (one of the vertex is counted twice)
% count: Total number of buildings in the area
% XYcenter: Contains the centroid of each building
% MD: maximum distance of any vertex of any building from its 
%    centroid

%   First we shift our origin to the first point

%Instead of searching over all buildings just search over nearby buildings
%that could actually intersect the line segment based on the building
%statistics (maximum distance between the centroid of a building and the line segment)
